# Sage: a SPARQL query engine for public Linked Data providers
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sage-org/sage-engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sage-org/sage-engine) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/sage-engine.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/sage-engine)

SaGe is a SPARQL query engine for public Linked Data providers that implements *Web preemption*. The SPARQL engine includes a smart Sage client
and a Sage SPARQL query server hosting RDF datasets (hosted using [HDT](http://www.rdfhdt.org/)).
This repository contains the **Python implementation of the SaGe SPARQL query server**.

SPARQL queries are suspended by the web server after a fixed quantum of time and resumed upon client request. Using Web preemption, Sage ensures stable response times for query execution and completeness of results under high load.

The complete approach and experimental results are available in a Research paper accepted at The Web Conference 2019, [available here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02017155/document). *Thomas Minier, Hala Skaf-Molli and Pascal Molli.

# Installation

## Installation using pip (with the HDT backend)

Installation in a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) is **strongly advised!**

Requirements:
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
* **gcc/clang** with **c++11 support**
* **Python Development headers**
> You should have the `Python.h` header available on your system.   
> For example, for Python 3.6, install the `python3.6-dev` package on Debian/Ubuntu systems.

The core engine of the SaGe SPARQL query server with [HDT](http://www.rdfhdt.org/) as a backend can be installed as follows:
```bash
pip install sage-engine[hdt]
```

## Manual installation (with the HDT backend)

Additional requirements:
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (shipped with Node.js on most systems)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sage-org/sage-engine
cd sage-engine/
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .[hdt]
```

# Getting started

## Server configuration

A Sage server is configured using a configuration file in [YAML syntax](http://yaml.org/).
You will find below a minimal working example of such configuration file.
A full example is available [in the `config_examples/` directory](https://github.com/sage-org/sage-engine/blob/master/config_examples/example.yaml)

```yaml
name: SaGe Test server
maintainer: Chuck Norris
quota: 75
max_results: 2000
datasets:
-
  name: dbpedia
  description: DBPedia
  backend: hdt-file
  file: datasets/dbpedia.2016.hdt
```

The `quota` and `max_results` fields are used to set the maximum time quantum and the maximum number of results
allowed per request, respectively.

Each entry in the `datasets` field declare a RDF dataset with a name, description, backend and options specific to this backend.
Currently, **only** the `hdt-file` backend is supported, which allow a Sage server to load RDF datasets from [HDT files](http://www.rdfhdt.org/). Sage uses [pyHDT](https://github.com/Callidon/pyHDT) to load and query HDT files.

## Starting the server

The `sage` executable, installed alongside the Sage server, allows to easily start a Sage server from a configuration file using [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/), a Python WSGI HTTP Server.

```bash
# launch Sage server with 4 workers on port 8000
sage my_config.yaml -w 4 -p 8000
```

The full usage of the `sage` executable is detailed below:
```
usage: sage [-h] [-p P] [-w W] [--log-level LEVEL] config

Launch the Sage server using a configuration file

positional arguments:
  config             Path to the configuration file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -p P, --port P     The port to bind (default: 8000)
  -w W, --workers W  The number of server workers (default: 4)
  --log-level LEVEL  The granularity of log outputs (default: info)
```

# SaGe Docker image

The Sage server is also available through a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/callidon/sage/).
In order to use it, do not forget to [mount in the container](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) the directory that contains you configuration file and your datasets.

```bash
docker pull callidon/sage
docker run -v path/to/config-file:/opt/data/ -p 8000:8000 callidon/sage sage /opt/data/config.yaml -w 4 -p 8000
```

Notice: you can also use [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/sage-org/sage-engine/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) instead of the long docker run command. 

# Documentation

To generate the documentation, you must install the following dependencies

```bash
pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme sphinxcontrib-httpdomain
```

Then, navigate in the `docs` directory and generate the documentation

```bash
cd docs/
make html
open build/html/index.html
```
